  <h1>From ‘Goodfellas’ to ‘Flower Moon’: How<br>Scorsese Has Rethought Violence</h1>

  <p>The director was long identified with ornately edited set pieces. In “The Irishman” and his latest<br>
  film, the flourishes have given way to blunt truths.</p>
  
  <img src="graphics/scorsese.png"style="width:700px;height:278px;">
  
  <p>Of all the haunting images and disturbing sounds that permeate Martin Scorsese’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/movies/killers-of-the-flower-moon-review-martin-scorsese.html">“Killers of the<br>
  Flower Moon,”</a> none is more upsetting than the guttural cry from Mollie Burkhart (Lily<br>
  Gladstone), a tortured wail of rage and grief that escapes her reserved visage when tragedy<br>
  strikes. And it often does: “Killers” tells the true story, adapted from the book by David Grann,<br>
  of how Mollie’s Osage community was decimated by murderous white men, who killed dozens<br>
  of her tribe members for rights to their oil-rich land.</p>
  
  <p>Mollie’s howl of pain is not quite like any sound heard before in a Scorsese film. But in many<br>
  ways, Scorsese is emulating her jarring cry in the ominous aesthetics of “Killers of the Flower<br>
  Moon” itself, and of his 2019 feature, “The Irishman.”</p>
