  <h1>From ‘Goodfellas’ to ‘Flower Moon’: How
  Scorsese Has Rethought Violence</h1>
  <p>The director was long identified with ornately edited set pieces. In “The Irishman” and his latest
  film, the flourishes have given way to blunt truths.</p>

  <p>Of all the haunting images and disturbing sounds that permeate Martin Scorsese’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/movies/killers-of-the-flower-moon-review-martin-scorsese.html">“Killers of the
  Flower Moon,”</a> none is more upsetting than the guttural cry from Mollie Burkhart (Lily
  Gladstone), a tortured wail of rage and grief that escapes her reserved visage when tragedy
  strikes. And it often does: “Killers” tells the true story, adapted from the book by David Grann,
  of how Mollie’s Osage community was decimated by murderous white men, who killed dozens
  of her tribe members for rights to their oil-rich land.</p>
  
  <p>Mollie’s howl of pain is not quite like any sound heard before in a Scorsese film. But in many
  ways, Scorsese is emulating her jarring cry in the ominous aesthetics of “Killers of the Flower
  Moon” itself, and of his 2019 feature, “The Irishman.”</p>
